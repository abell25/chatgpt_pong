# chatgpt_pong

The code for this HTML5 canvas game was 100% created from chatGPT.

It struggled creating the game in it's entirety from a single prompt (as expected) but when I asked about how to implement indivual components it had no trouble doing so.  Except for one bug (I added a comment in the code) all of the code otherwise worked without any modification.
